# C# Cipher Winforms App

### Description
This is a simple C# Winforms app that encrypts and decrypts text.
It needs to be refactored and improved, but it works. Sort of.

### Features
There are four methods:
- **Caesar Cipher** (simple ROT13)
	- Accepts alphanumeric input, ignores special characters
- **Keyboard Cipher** (swaps letters on the keyboard)
	- Accepts alphanumeric input, ignores special characters
- **Morse Code** (converts text to morse code)
	- Encryp accepts alphanumeric characters, outputs morse code separated by slashes (spaces between words)
	- Decrypt accepts morse code ('.', '-', '/' and ' ')
- **Binary** (converts text to binary)
	- Encrypt accepts alphanumeric characters, outputs binary (spaces between words)
	- Decrypt accepts binary (0, 1 and ' ')


### How to use
1. Open Visual Studio
2. Clone the repository
3. Run the application
4. Enter the text you want to encrypt/decrypt
5. Where it can encrypt/decrypt the text, the output will be displayed
6. You can save the outputs to a .txt file with the "save" button
